XML file processing:

It's a tester for xml files as i am using xml files to store data processed by an artificial intelligence model for violence detection in cities.
So it's a part from my big project for the conception of a smart camera that detect violence and send alarm signal to othorities.
The app can dot the followinf things:

validate xml file structure
validate xml file content 
Generate test reports
Link between error message and its location in the tree
Adaptive error display window size

The following figure expose the architecture that I am trying to elaborate and the part that I choose for this task is in blue
